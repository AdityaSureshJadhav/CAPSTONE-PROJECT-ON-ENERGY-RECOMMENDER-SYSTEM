# CAPSTONE-PROJECT-ON-ENERGY-RECOMMENDER-SYSTEM
Building an energy recommender system using unsupervised learning involves creating a model that can analyze patterns and relationships within the energy consumption data without labeled training examples. Unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, can be applied for this purpose
